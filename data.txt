Food Friend	Joshua Agee:Lucious Lokko:Abdoul Ridwane	Food Friend is an app that aims to help people make great meals with food that they currently have in their kitchen. List the food ingredients you have in your kitchen and Food Friend will find recipes for you based on the ingredients you list in the ingredients bar. Through social media, you can rate recipes, and make suggestions to your friends. If the recipe is to your satisfaction, you can rate or rank it in the app and on social media.	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josh5agee/Josh/master/finalProject/logo.jpg	http://rawgit.com/josh5agee/Josh/master/finalProject/index.html	https://github.com/josh5agee/Josh/tree/master/finalProject
The Writers Playground	Mohinur Miah:Taseen Seeam:Chris Quinche	Our project, “The Writer’s Playground” is a educational/social website where anyone can practice their writing skills. The user will be given a random word and will have to write a story within a certain time limit. When the time is up, the writer can choose to keep it private or make it public, where everyone can respond to it. This application will expand user’s literacy, creativity, and social skills in a fun challenging way.	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cquincheASC4/The-Writer-Playground/master/logo2.png	https://cquincheasc4.github.io/The-Writer-Playground/	https://github.com/cquincheASC4/The-Writer-Playground

TEM Shop	Elijah Atwell:Mohammadou Gningue:Tahmidur Rabb	TEM Shop is a website that allows one to search for the cheapest online price for many retailers and buy it on that one website. (ex: Trivago finds the same hotels for the lowest prices while allowing the user to book on Trivago.) We believe TEM Shop will revolutionize online shopping because now, a shopper is given the ability to do everything on one website while also getting the cheapest price.	img/tem.png	https://mgningueasc4.github.io/Mohammadou/DEMODAY/	https://github.com/mgningueASC4/Mohammadou/tree/master/DEMODAY
